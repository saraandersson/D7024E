# run it when the container starts.

# See https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/ for a reference of all

# In order to use this file together with the docker-compose.yml file in the
# same directory, you need to ensure the image you build gets the name
# "kadlab", which you do by using the following command:

FROM golang:alpine
WORKDIR /source
COPY udpclient.go /source
RUN go build udpclient.go
CMD ./udpclient
